* Name of the application is changed from NUnitResults to NUnit-Results.
  The executable is nunit-results.exe in keeping with the naming of
  othe NUnit-related applications.

  and displayed correctly.

* Parameterized tests are no longer counted twice in reports.

  Failures and Not Run tables.
  
* Stack traces are displayed using <pre> so that they lay out
  in the same way as when displayed by .NET.

  recognized and the contained method suites no longer appear 
  as fixtures. (See the README for a limitation.)
  
* FileNotFoundException no longer displays a stack trace.
